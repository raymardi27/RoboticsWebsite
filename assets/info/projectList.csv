1,tic-tac-toe.jpeg,Tic-Tac-Toe,https://github.com/Yashprime1/Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Arduino,/Tic-Tac-Toe,The famous Tic-Tac-Toe is brought to action through the amazing lcd display(20*4) and Arduino using push buttons to control it.
2,led-controller.jpeg,Control LED Using Your Voice Command,https://github.com/P-Chandana,/led-controller,The main objective of the project is to develop a home automation system using an Arduino board with bluetooth being remotely controlled by any Android OS smartphone. As technology is advancing so houses are also getting smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems, involving remote controlled switches. In order to achieve this, a Bluetooth module is interfaced to the Arduino board at the receiver end while on the transmitter end, a GUI application on the cell phone sends ON/OFF commands to the receiver where loads are connected.

4,door-opener-rfid.JPG,Door Opener RFID Card,https://github.com/Simple2001,/door-opener-rfid,The project is about making a module which is low by cost and very effective in function. The module works on the key components such as Arduino UNO and RFID card.
5,door-opener-fingerprint.jpg,Door opener using fingerprint,https://github.com/Simple2001,/door-opener-fingerprint,The project is about making a module which is low by cost and very effective in function of opening the door using fingerprint. The module works on the key components such as Arduino UNO and fingerprint reader.
6,water-level-indicator.jpg,Water Level indicator,https://github.com/Vinuthna3031,/water-level-indicator,This is a simple water level indicator. It basically indicates the level of water using LEDs. If the water level reaches the top and is about to overflow, it will indicate that with an LED as well as with the buzzer. It is just a small application of using Arduino not going into the deeper sense.
